# mixed-messages-illia

It generates random (and silly) messages each time a function is called

## How exactly does it work?

+ You feed the function, `mixedMessageGenerator()`, three arrays.
+ Each array consists of various options of the message parts, as follows:

1. The intro
2. The situation
3. The punchline

### Try it out yourself

You can try and run the `script.js` on your Terminal / Command Prompt (*make sure you first fork the repository and then clone it into your machine*).
If you want, you can create your own three arrays, each containing no matter how many string elements inside it.
